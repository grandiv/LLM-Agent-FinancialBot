⎿ Implementation Plan: LLM-Powered Financial Agent (7 Days)

     Project Overview

     Extend your existing FinancialBot by replacing regex patterns with OpenRouter LLM integration for
     natural language understanding and intelligent financial advice.

     What Your Bot Will Become

     Current State: Rule-based bot with hardcoded regex patternsTarget State: Intelligent LLM agent
     that:
     - Understands natural Indonesian conversations (no fixed patterns needed)
     - Extracts transaction data from casual messages
     - Provides personalized financial advice using AI reasoning
     - Maintains conversation context for follow-up questions
     - Falls back gracefully if LLM fails

     Architecture Explanation

     How the Project Will Work

     User sends Discord message → Discord Bot (bot.py)
                                   ↓
                         Strip mention & get user context
                                   ↓
                         LLM Agent Core (new: core/llm_agent.py)
                                   ↓
                 ┌─────────────────┴─────────────────┐
                 ↓                                   ↓
         OpenRouter API Call              Conversation History
         (Claude/GPT models)              (short-term memory)
                 ↓                                   ↓
         Structured JSON Response          Context for follow-ups
                 ↓

         ↓                ↓

     (core/database.py) (format & send to Discord)

     Key Components

     1. LLM Agent Layer (core/llm_agent.py)
       - Sends user messages to OpenRouter with financial context
       - Uses function calling to determine intent (income/expense/balance/advice)
       - Maintains last 5 messages for context
       - Handles errors gracefully
     2. Prompt Engineering (core/prompts.py)
       - System prompt defining bot's personality & capabilities
       - Instructions for structured output (JSON format)
       - Examples of Indonesian financial conversations
     3. OpenRouter Integration
       - Uses OpenAI-compatible API format
       - Model selection: anthropic/claude-3-haiku (cheap, fast) or meta-llama/llama-3-8b-instruct
     (free)
       - Request format: Chat completions with function calling
     4. Existing Components (Keep & Modify)
       - core/database.py: Keep as-is (already works)
       - core/bot_core.py: Simplify - remove regex, call LLM agent
       - bot.py: Minor updates for error handling

     Technical Implementation Details

     New Dependencies

     openai>=1.0.0  # For OpenRouter API (OpenAI-compatible)

     Environment Variables (.env)

     DISCORD_TOKEN=your_token
     OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_key
     OPENROUTER_MODEL=anthropic/claude-3-haiku  # or meta-llama/llama-3-8b-instruct (free)
     DATABASE_PATH=financial_bot.db

     LLM Agent Function Calling Schema

     The LLM will respond with JSON indicating intent:

     {
       "intent": "record_income",
       "amount": 5000000,
       "category": "gaji",
       "description": "bonus akhir tahun",
       "response_text": "Wah, selamat untuk bonus akhir tahunnya! Saya sudah mencatat pemasukan sebesar
     Rp 5,000,000."
     }

     Supported intents:
     - record_income: Log income transaction
     - record_expense: Log expense transaction
     - check_balance: Show current balance
     - get_report: Show financial summary
     - budget_advice: Provide financial advice
     - purchase_analysis: Analyze purchase affordability
     - casual_chat: General conversation
     - help: Show capabilities

     Prompt Strategy

     System Prompt:
     You are a friendly Indonesian financial assistant helping users track their finances.
     Your name is FinancialBot. You understand casual and formal Indonesian.

     Capabilities:
     - Record income and expenses
     - Show balance and financial reports
     - Provide budget advice
     - Analyze purchase decisions

     Always respond in Indonesian. Extract transaction details when users mention money.
     Return responses as JSON with intent, extracted data, and friendly response text.

     User Context (sent with each message):
     User's current balance: Rp 2,500,000
     Recent transactions: [last 3]
     Conversation history: [last 5 messages]

     Cost Estimation

     OpenRouter Pricing (per 1K tokens)

     Recommended Model:
     - anthropic/claude-3-haiku: $0.00025 input / $0.00125 output
     - Average conversation: ~500 tokens = $0.0005 (less than 1 cent)
     - 1000 conversations = ~$0.50

     Free Alternative:
     - meta-llama/llama-3-8b-instruct: FREE
     - Slightly lower quality but still very good

     Budget for testing: $2-5 should cover entire development and demo

     Simplicity Assessment

     Why This Is the Simplest Approach

     1. Leverage existing architecture: Keep 80% of your code
     2. OpenRouter is simple: Uses OpenAI-compatible API (well-documented)
     3. No complex AI infrastructure: Just API calls, no model hosting
     4. Minimal new code: ~300 lines for LLM agent core
     5. No platform change: Keep Discord (already working)
     6. Familiar tools: Python, same libraries, same database

     Complexity Level: Medium-Low

     - If you've made API calls before: Easy
     - New to APIs but know Python: Moderate
     - Total new code: ~400 lines
     - Most time spent on: Prompt engineering & testing conversations

     ---
     Assessment Criteria Alignment

     1. Background/Problem: "Financial tracking is too rigid with commands. People speak naturally. LLM
     agent understands casual Indonesian and provides intelligent advice."
     2. Agent Complexity:
       - Function calling for structured output
       - Conversation memory for context
       - Financial reasoning capabilities
       - Multi-intent handling
       - Score potential: High (real LLM integration with practical use case)
     3. Report Clarity: Will explain architecture, show code examples, include conversation demos
     4. Presentation Clarity: Will demonstrate live conversation, show how LLM understands various
     inputs, explain technical decisions

     Risk Mitigation

     Potential Issues & Solutions

     1. OpenRouter API fails during demo
       - Solution: Add fallback to simple rule-based responses
       - Cache common responses
     2. LLM responses are inconsistent
       - Solution: Strong prompt engineering with examples
       - Use function calling for structured output
       - Validate JSON responses
     3. Costs exceed budget
       - Solution: Use free Llama model for development
       - Use Haiku only for final testing/demo
       - Set rate limits in code
     4. Indonesian responses are poor
       - Solution: Add Indonesian examples in system prompt
       - Test multiple models (Claude vs GPT vs Llama)
       - Fine-tune prompts with better instructions
